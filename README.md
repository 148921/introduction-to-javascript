## Focus of this lesson
This lesson is oriented around teaching you how to use Javascript client-side in the browser. In order to get the most out of the lesson it helps if you have some past experience with web technologies such as HTML and HTTP.

## What you need
- A computer with a modern browser installed  ( [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) / [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/#) / [Internet Explorer](https://dev.modern.ie/) )
- A text editor. Any will do, but it helps to use one that's JavaScript-aware ( [Atom](https://atom.io/) / [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) / [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) / [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) / [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) / [Whatever](https://xkcd.com/378/) )
