# Introduction to JavaScript
JavaScript is the most used language today, and there is no escaping it. Learn the basics in this lesson.

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript or (ECMAscript) is a programming language mostly used client-side to dynamically script webpages, but often also server-side. JavaScript is not related to Java.

JavaScript is mostly used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content using the DOM, send and receive data via AJAX, draw graphics using canvas, interact with the device running the browser, and so on.

JavaScript can also be used server-side, using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), enabling developers to build fully functional web applications using a feature rich collection of core modules that handles file system I/O, networking, streams, and more.

## What you need
- A computer with a modern browser installed  (Chrome/Firefox/Internet Explorer)
- A text editor. Any will do, but it helps to use one that's JavaScript-aware ([Atom](https://atom.io/)/[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)/[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)/[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)/[Whatever](https://xkcd.com/378/))
